Elastic Studio implements a progressive decentralization model, transitioning from team-led governance to full community control. This document specifies the governance structure, voting mechanisms, and upgrade processes.

## Governance Philosophy

### Core Principles

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Stakeholder Alignment" icon="handshake">
    Governance power distributed to those with long-term commitment (stakers)

  <Card title="Gradual Decentralization" icon="timeline">
    Progressive transfer of control from team to community

### Governance Scope

| Domain | Governance Control | Constraints |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Protocol parameters** | Full | Within defined bounds |
| **Treasury allocation** | Full | Subject to timelock |
| **Smart contract upgrades** | Partial | Guardian veto |
| **Fee structures** | Full | Maximum caps |
| **Slashing conditions** | Limited | Minimum thresholds |
| **Emergency actions** | None (Guardian only) | — |

    Phase1 -->|6 months| Phase2
    Phase2 -->|12 months| Phase3
    Phase3 -->|24+ months| Phase4
```

### Phase 1: Foundation (Launch → 6 months)

**Governance model**: Team-controlled multisig

| Role | Control | Composition |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Admin Multisig** | Protocol upgrades, parameters | 3-of-5 team members |
| **Treasury Multisig** | Fund allocation | 4-of-7 (3 team, 4 external) |
| **Guardian** | Emergency pause | 2-of-3 security team |

**Rationale**: Rapid iteration and bug fixes during early deployment.

### Phase 2: Hybrid (6 → 18 months)

**Governance model**: Community council + team

| Role | Control | Selection |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Community Council** | Parameter proposals | Elected by token holders |
| **Team** | Technical implementation | Appointed |
| **Guardian** | Emergency veto | Multisig |

**Council composition**:
- 7 seats total
- 4 elected by token vote
- 2 appointed by team
- 1 rotating labeler representative

### Phase 3: Full DAO (18+ months)

**Governance model**: Token-weighted voting

| Mechanism | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Voting power** | 1 ELASTIC staked = 1 vote |
| **Proposal threshold** | 100,000 ELASTIC |
| **Quorum** | 4% of staked supply |
| **Voting period** | 7 days |
| **Timelock** | 2 days |

### Phase 4: Protocol Ossification (Long-term)

**Governance model**: Minimal governance, immutable core

- Core consensus mechanism becomes immutable
- Only peripheral parameters remain adjustable
- Emergency mechanisms preserved
- Focus shifts to application layer

## Voting Mechanism

### Proposal Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft: Create proposal
    Draft --> Discussion: Post to forum
    Discussion --> Pending: Submit on-chain
    Pending --> Active: Delay period ends
    Active --> Succeeded: Quorum + majority
    Active --> Defeated: No quorum or minority
    Succeeded --> Queued: Timelock
    Queued --> Executed: Execute
    Queued --> Cancelled: Guardian veto
    Executed --> [*]
    Defeated --> [*]
    Cancelled --> [*]
```

### Proposal Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Parameter Change">
    **Description**: Modify adjustable protocol parameters
    
    **Requirements**:
    - Proposal threshold: 100,000 ELASTIC
    - Quorum: 4%
    - Approval: >50%
    - Timelock: 2 days
    
    **Adjustable parameters**:

    | Liquidity | 10M ELASTIC | 30M ELASTIC |
    | Partnerships | 5M ELASTIC | 15M ELASTIC |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Protocol Upgrade">
    **Description**: Deploy new smart contract versions
    
    **Requirements**:
    - Proposal threshold: 500,000 ELASTIC
    - Quorum: 10%
    - Approval: >66%
    - Timelock: 14 days
    - Guardian non-veto
    
    **Process**:
    1. Code audit required
    2. Testnet deployment (7 days minimum)
    3. Proposal submission
    4. Voting period
    5. Timelock with guardian review
    6. Execution
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Emergency Action">
    **Description**: Guardian-initiated emergency response
    
    **NOT subject to voting**:
    - Pause contracts
    - Freeze suspicious accounts
    - Activate circuit breakers
    
    **Post-hoc governance**:
    - Guardian actions must be ratified within 7 days
    - Unratified actions automatically reverse (if possible)
    - Guardian can be replaced by governance vote
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Voting Power Calculation

Voting power is determined by staked tokens with time-weighting:

$$
V_i = S_i \cdot \sqrt{\min(t_i, 365)}
$$

Where:
- S_i = tokens staked by address i
- t_i = days staked (capped at 365)

**Rationale**: Square root time factor rewards long-term commitment without creating excessive lock-in advantages.

### Delegation

Token holders can delegate voting power:

| Delegation Type | Description | Revocation |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| **Full delegation** | All votes to delegate | Instant |
| **Split delegation** | Divide among multiple delegates | Instant |
| **Conditional** | Delegate only for certain proposal types | Instant |

---

## Guardian Role

### Guardian Powers

The Guardian is a security-focused role with limited emergency powers:

| Power | Conditions | Scope |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Pause contracts** | Suspected exploit | All contracts |
| **Veto proposals** | Security concerns | Protocol upgrades only |
| **Freeze accounts** | Evidence of attack | Individual accounts |
| **Activate circuit breakers** | Anomaly detection | Automatic |

### Guardian Constraints

<Warning>
Guardian powers are subject to significant constraints to prevent abuse.
</Warning>

| Constraint | Specification |
|------------|---------------|
| **Veto window** | 48 hours after proposal success |
| **Veto override** | 80% supermajority can override |
| **Pause duration** | Maximum 7 days without governance approval |
| **Guardian replacement** | 66% governance vote |
| **Action reporting** | All actions logged on-chain |

### Guardian Composition

| Phase | Composition | Threshold |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Phase 1 | 3 team security members | 2-of-3 |
| Phase 2 | 5 members (3 team, 2 external) | 3-of-5 |
| Phase 3+ | 7 members (2 team, 5 elected) | 4-of-7 |

## Upgrade Mechanisms

### Contract Upgradeability

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Proxy Pattern">
    **Used for**: Core protocol contracts (Staking, Rewards)
    
    **Pattern**: Transparent proxy with admin
    
    ```
    User → Proxy → Implementation v1
                 ↓ (upgrade)
           → Implementation v2
    ```
    
    **Safeguards**:
    - Timelock on upgrades
    - Storage layout verification
    - Audit required
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Immutable">
    **Used for**: Token contract, Reputation snapshots
    
    **Rationale**: Core token functionality should never change
    
    **Migration path**: Deploy new contract + migration period
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Modular">
    **Used for**: Consensus algorithms, Access layer
    
    **Pattern**: Registry-based module system
    
    ```
    Registry → Module A (active)
             → Module B (deprecated)
             → Module C (pending)
    ```
    
    **Benefits**: Gradual rollout, easy rollback
