<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Industry Rivalry (Medium-High)" icon="fire">
    **Assessment**: Fragmented market with several well-funded players competing on different dimensions.
    
    - Scale AI dominates enterprise
    - Labelbox strong in self-service
    - Many regional/specialized players
    - Price competition in commodity segment
    
    **Implication**: Differentiation through mechanism (not just features) is key
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Supplier Power (Low)" icon="users">
    **Assessment**: Large global pool of potential labelers, no single supplier has leverage.
    
    - Millions of potential annotators worldwide
    - Skills are learnable (not specialized)
    - Platform creates value, not individual labelers
    
    **Implication**: Protocol design matters more than supplier relationships
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Buyer Power (Medium)" icon="building">
    **Assessment**: Buyers have options but switching costs exist.
    
    - Low switching costs between platforms
    - BUT: data already labeled has value
    - Enterprise buyers want reliability
    - Quality requirements create stickiness
    
    **Implication**: Quality and reliability create retention
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Threat of New Entrants (Medium)" icon="door-open">
    **Assessment**: Significant capital and network effects required.
    
    - Technology is replicable
    - Workforce networks take time to build
    - Reputation systems have cold-start problem
    - Regulatory complexity increasing
    
    **Implication**: First-mover advantage in crypto-native segment
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Threat of Substitutes (Medium)" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    **Assessment**: Synthetic data and AI-assisted labeling are emerging.
    
    - LLMs can generate training data
    - BUT: hallucinations, bias, homogeneity issues
    - Hybrid approaches likely to dominate
    - Human verification still required
    
    **Implication**: Position as "verified" data, not commodity labeling
