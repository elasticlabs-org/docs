## Abstract

This paper presents the economic model for the ELASTIC token, the native cryptocurrency of the Elastic Studio protocol. We analyze the token's role in coordinating decentralized data labeling, examine the incentive structures that align participant behavior, and prove that the economic design achieves desired equilibrium properties.

---

## 1. Introduction

Token economics design is a mechanism design problem: how do we structure incentives such that individually rational behavior produces collectively optimal outcomes? For Elastic Studio, the collective optimum is high-quality labeled data; the mechanism must make producing such data the dominant strategy for rational participants.

**Design Objectives:**

1. **Participation Incentive**: Make labeling economically attractive
2. **Quality Incentive**: Make accurate labeling more profitable than random guessing
3. **Long-term Alignment**: Reward sustained contribution over one-time extraction
4. **Security Budget**: Ensure attack costs exceed potential gains
5. **Value Capture**: Tie token value to protocol utility

### 1.1 Token Functions

ELASTIC serves four primary functions:

| Function | Mechanism | Economic Role |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Staking** | Lock tokens to participate | Sybil resistance, skin in game |
| **Payment** | Exchange for data access | Demand driver |
| **Governance** | Weighted voting rights | Decentralized control |
| **Reward** | Compensation for work | Incentive distribution |

Each function creates distinct demand pressure and utility, contributing to token value.

## 2. Token Specification

**Technical Parameters:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Standard | ERC-20 |
| Network | EVM-compatible L2 (Base/Arbitrum) |
| Total Supply | 1,000,000,000 ELASTIC (fixed) |
| Decimals | 18 |
| Governance | On-chain voting |

The fixed supply creates scarcity, while the L2 deployment ensures low transaction costs for frequent micro-transactions inherent in labeling workflows.

## 3. Token Distribution

### 3.1 Allocation Model

Initial token allocation balances stakeholder interests:

| Category | Allocation | Amount | Vesting |
|----------|------------|--------|---------|
| Community Rewards | 40% | 400M | 5-year emission |
| Treasury | 20% | 200M | DAO-controlled |
| Team & Advisors | 15% | 150M | 1-year cliff, 3-year linear |
| Investors | 15% | 150M | 6-month cliff, 2-year linear |
| Ecosystem Fund | 10% | 100M | Grants, on-demand |

**Rationale:**

- **Community majority (40%)**: Ensures labelers capture primary value
- **Long vesting**: Aligns insiders with long-term protocol success
- **Treasury flexibility**: Enables protocol-directed investments
- **Ecosystem fund**: Supports integration and growth initiatives

### 3.2 Emission Schedule

Community rewards follow an exponential decay emission schedule:

$$
E(t) = E_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda t}
$$

where:
- E₀ = 80,000,000 ELASTIC (Year 1 emission)
- λ = 0.15 (decay constant)
- t = years since launch

**Emission Table:**

| Year | Annual Emission | Cumulative | % of Allocation |
|------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 80M | 80M | 20% |
| 2 | 69M | 149M | 37% |
| 3 | 59M | 208M | 52% |
| 4 | 51M | 259M | 65% |
| 5 | 44M | 303M | 76% |
| 6+ | Remainder | 400M | 100% |

**Design Rationale:**

The decreasing emission incentivizes early participation while ensuring sustainable long-term rewards. Early contributors take more risk and should capture more value; later contributors benefit from established protocol infrastructure.

## 4. Staking Economics

### 4.1 Stake as Entry Requirement

Labelers must stake ELASTIC tokens to participate. This requirement serves multiple purposes:

1. **Sybil Resistance**: Creating fake identities requires real capital
2. **Accountability**: Stake can be slashed for misbehavior
3. **Alignment**: Labelers become token holders with protocol stake
4. **Quality Signal**: Higher stake indicates stronger commitment

### 4.2 Stake Tiers

The protocol defines four stake tiers with increasing privileges:

| Tier | Minimum Stake | Task Access | Multiplier |
|------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Bronze | 1,000 | Basic tasks | 1.0× |
| Silver | 10,000 | Standard tasks | 1.5× |
| Gold | 100,000 | Premium tasks | 2.0× |
| Diamond | 1,000,000 | All + Priority | 3.0× |

**Economic Interpretation:**

Higher tiers require 10× the stake for less than 2× the reward multiplier. This sublinear scaling prevents plutocratic dominance while rewarding commitment:

$$
\text{Marginal multiplier} = \frac{\Delta m_S}{\Delta S} = \frac{0.5}{9,000} \text{ for Bronze} \rightarrow \text{Silver}
$$

The marginal benefit decreases with higher stakes, encouraging distributed participation over whale concentration.

### 4.3 Staking Yield

Long-term stakers earn additional yield from protocol emissions:

| Lock Period | APY |
|-------------|-----|
| No lock | 5% |
| 3 months | 10% |
| 6 months | 15% |
| 12 months | 25% |

The yield calculation:

$$
Y = S \cdot \text{APY} \cdot \frac{t}{365}
$$

**Time Preference Design:**

The yield premium for longer locks compensates for reduced liquidity and opportunity cost. The 5× multiplier between no-lock and 12-month reflects the substantial commitment difference.

**Early Unlock Penalty:**

| Lock Period | Penalty |
|-------------|---------|
| 3 months | 20% of stake |
| 6 months | 30% of stake |
| 12 months | 50% of stake |

Penalties are distributed: 50% to remaining stakers, 50% burned.

## 5. Reward Mechanisms

### 5.1 Labeling Rewards

Labelers earn rewards for completing tasks. The reward formula:

$$
r_i = \frac{P}{N} \cdot m_R(R_i) \cdot m_S(S_i) \cdot m_A(a_i)
$$

where:
- P = task reward pool
- N = number of labelers
- m_R = reputation multiplier
- m_S = stake multiplier
- m_A = agreement multiplier

### 5.2 Multiplier Functions

**Reputation Multiplier:**

$$
m_R(R) = 0.5 + 1.5 \cdot \frac{R}{1000}
$$

Range: [0.5, 2.0] for R ∈ [0, 1000]

The linear scaling rewards reputation accumulation proportionally. A labeler with maximum reputation earns 4× the reward of a zero-reputation labeler.

**Stake Multiplier:**

As defined in stake tiers (1.0× to 3.0×).

**Agreement Multiplier:**

$$
m_A(a) = 0.5 + a
$$

where a ∈ [0, 1] is agreement with consensus.

Range: [0.5, 1.5]

**Composite Effect:**

The multiplicative combination creates strong performance incentives:

| Profile | m_R | m_S | m_A | Combined |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|----------|
| Low performer | 0.5 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 0.25× |
| Average | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0× |
| High performer | 2.0 | 2.0 | 1.5 | 6.0× |

A high performer earns 24× the reward of a low performer for the same task—a substantial incentive for quality.

### 5.3 Usage Royalties

Labelers receive ongoing royalties when their contributed data is accessed:

$$
\rho_i = F \cdot (1 - \phi_{\text{protocol}}) \cdot \frac{w_i}{\sum_j w_j}
$$

where:
- F = access fee
- φ_protocol = 0.20 (20% protocol fee)
- w_i = labeler i's contribution weight

**Economic Significance:**

Royalties create sustainable income streams for quality labelers. Unlike one-time task rewards, royalties continue indefinitely, incentivizing:
1. Contributing to high-demand datasets
2. Maintaining accuracy (affects contribution weight)
3. Long-term protocol participation

### 5.4 Reward Example

**Scenario:** Task with P = 30 ELASTIC, N = 3 labelers

**Labeler Profile:**
- Reputation: R = 800
- Stake: 50,000 ELASTIC (Gold tier)
- Agreement: a = 0.95

**Calculation:**
- Base reward: 30 / 3 = 10 ELASTIC
- m_R = 0.5 + 1.5 × 0.8 = 1.7
- m_S = 2.0 (Gold tier)
- m_A = 0.5 + 0.95 = 1.45

**Final Reward:** 10 × 1.7 × 2.0 × 1.45 = **49.3 ELASTIC**

This represents a 4.93× multiplier on base reward, demonstrating the substantial premium for quality performance.

## 6. Fee Structure

### 6.1 Protocol Fees

| Fee Type | Rate | Recipient |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Data access | 20% | Treasury |
| Labeling rewards | 5% | Treasury |
| Stake/unstake | 0.1% | Burn |
| Dispute resolution | 1% | Review panel |

### 6.2 Fee Allocation

Treasury fees are allocated:

| Purpose | Allocation |
|---------|------------|
| Development | 50% |
| Staker rewards | 30% |
| Token burn | 15% |
| Insurance fund | 5% |

---

## 7. Deflationary Mechanisms

### 7.1 Burn Sources

Multiple mechanisms remove tokens from circulation:

1. **Transaction burns**: 0.1% of stake/unstake transactions
2. **Fee burns**: 15% of protocol fees used for buyback and burn
3. **Slashing burns**: 50% of slashed tokens
4. **Early unlock penalties**: 50% of penalties

### 7.2 Projected Burn Rate

| Year | Estimated Burn | Cumulative | % of Supply |
|------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | 10M | 10M | 1.0% |
| 2 | 15M | 25M | 2.5% |
| 3 | 25M | 50M | 5.0% |
| 5 | 50M | 100M | 10.0% |

### 7.3 Supply Dynamics

The effective circulating supply evolves as:

$$
S_{\text{circ}}(t) = S_{\text{emission}}(t) - S_{\text{burned}}(t) - S_{\text{locked}}(t)
$$

Early protocol phases may see net inflation as emissions exceed burns; mature phases should achieve net deflation as usage-driven burns exceed decreasing emissions.

## 8. Economic Security Analysis

### 8.1 Security Budget

The protocol's security derives from economic cost of attacks. The **security budget** is:

$$
\text{Security Budget} = \text{TVL} \cdot P(\text{slash}) \cdot E[\text{slash rate}]
$$

For the protocol to be secure:

$$
\text{Security Budget} > \text{Maximum extractable value}
$$

### 8.2 Attack Cost Model

An attacker attempting to corrupt consensus must:

1. Acquire stake for multiple identities
2. Build reputation (time cost)
3. Risk detection and slashing

**Minimum Attack Cost:**

$$
C_{\text{attack}} = S_{\min} \cdot k + T_{\text{rep}} \cdot \text{opportunity cost}
$$

where k is the number of Sybil identities needed.

**Expected Loss from Detection:**

$$
E[\text{loss}] = P(\text{detected}) \cdot \sigma \cdot C_{\text{stake}}
$$

With P(detected) ≈ 0.70 and σ ∈ [0.5, 1.0], the expected loss is substantial.

**Break-Even Analysis:**

For attack to be profitable:

$$
\text{Gain} > \frac{C_{\text{attack}}}{1 - P(\text{detected}) \cdot \sigma}
$$

With default parameters, this threshold is approximately 2-3× the initial stake investment, making small-scale attacks economically irrational.

### 8.3 Minimum Viable TVL

For economic security, the protocol requires:

$$
\text{TVL}_{\min} \geq k \cdot \text{Annual data value}
$$

where k ≥ 2 is the security multiplier.

This ensures the cost of corrupting the system exceeds the value that could be extracted.

## 9. Value Accrual

### 9.1 Token Value Drivers

Token value derives from utility demand:

$$
V = f(\text{Staking demand}, \text{Payment demand}, \text{Governance demand})
$$

**Staking Demand:**
- More labelers → more stake required
- Higher quality requirements → higher stake tiers
- Longer locks → reduced circulating supply

**Payment Demand:**
- More data consumers → more payment volume
- Higher data value → higher willingness to pay
- More integrations → more access requests

**Governance Demand:**
- More protocol value → more governance value
- More contentious decisions → more governance participation

### 9.2 Value Capture Mechanisms

The protocol captures value through:

1. **Direct fees**: 20% of access revenue to treasury
2. **Staking lock-up**: Reduces circulating supply
3. **Burns**: Permanent supply reduction
4. **Governance premium**: Right to direct treasury

### 9.3 Economic Model

Under equilibrium assumptions:

$$
\text{Token Value} \propto \frac{\text{Protocol Revenue}}{\text{Circulating Supply} \cdot \text{Velocity}}
$$

Growth strategies focus on increasing numerator (revenue through adoption) while decreasing denominator (supply through burns and locks).

## 10. Governance Parameters

The following parameters are adjustable via DAO governance:

| Parameter | Default | Range | Cooldown |
|-----------|---------|-------|----------|
| Protocol fee | 20% | 5-30% | 30 days |
| Minimum stake | 1,000 | 100-10,000 | 14 days |
| Staking APY | 5-25% | 0-50% | 7 days |
| Burn rate | 15% | 0-30% | 30 days |
| Consensus threshold | 70% | 50-90% | 14 days |

Cooldown periods prevent governance attacks and allow community response time.

---

## 11. Conclusion

The ELASTIC token economics create a self-reinforcing system where:

1. **Quality produces rewards**: Accurate labelers earn more
2. **Commitment produces rewards**: Longer stakes earn higher yields
3. **Attacks produce losses**: Malicious behavior is punished
4. **Usage produces value**: Protocol adoption increases token utility

The mechanism design ensures that individually rational behavior—maximizing personal returns—aligns with collective optimum—high-quality labeled data. This alignment is the fundamental contribution of cryptoeconomic systems to coordination problems.
